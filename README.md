Key Features
Master Password Protection: The journey begins when you set your master password. This crucial step acts as a gatekeeper for accessing all your stored passwords. By requiring this password upon entry, the application adds an essential layer of security, ensuring that only you can view your sensitive data.

The Password Manager enables you to securely store passwords associated with various websites. Each entry includes the website name and the corresponding password, making it easy to retrieve login credentials without having to remember them all. This feature not only simplifies your life but also helps enhance your online security.

View and Delete Functionality: Need to check a password? No problem! By simply re-entering your master password, you can securely view your stored passwords whenever you need them. And if you ever decide to delete an old password that you no longer use, the application allows you to do so with ease. This keeps your password storage organized and relevant, ensuring that you only keep what you need and reducing clutter.

Responsive Design: In today’s fast-paced world, accessing your passwords on various devices is essential.
